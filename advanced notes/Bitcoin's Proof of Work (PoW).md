## what is the cryptographic puzzle used in bitcoin

- The cryptographic puzzle used in Bitcoin's Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism is based on the SHA-256 hash function. Specifically, miners are tasked with finding a hash value that meets a certain difficulty level set by the network.

## what are the criteria for a valid block hash

- In Bitcoin's Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, the criteria for a valid block hash are determined by the target difficulty level set by the network.

- The target difficulty level specifies how difficult it is to find a valid hash for a block.

- ### Criteria for a valid block hash:

  1. <span style="color:orange">Leading Zeros</span>

     - The hash of a valid block must start with a certain number of leading zeros.
     - The number of leading zeros required is determined by the target difficulty level.
     - The more leading zeros required, the lower the probability of finding a valid hash.

  2. <span style="color:orange">Below Target Threshold</span>

  - The hash of a valid block must be below a certain target threshold.
  - This threshold is inversely proportional to the difficulty level.
  - A lower target threshold means a higher difficulty level and vice versa.
  - The hash value is interpreted as a large number, and if it's smaller than the target threshold, it's considered valid.

    def isValidBlockHash(blockHeader, targetDifficulty):
        # Calculate the hash of the block header
        hash = SHA256(blockHeader)

        # Get the prefix of the hash based on the target difficulty
        targetPrefix = '0' * targetDifficulty

        # Check if the hash meets the target difficulty
        return hash.startswith(targetPrefix)
