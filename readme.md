## Genesis block

- The first block in a blockchain is called a Genesis block.

## Proof of work (PoW)

- Proof of work (PoW) is a system used in some blockchains to verify transactions and add new blocks to the ledger.

- It's essentially a way for a decentralized network to agree on the validity of information without a central authority.

- In a PoW system, participants, known as miners, compete to solve complex mathematical puzzles. These puzzles require computational power to solve but are easy to verify once solved.

- The difficulty of the cryptographic puzzle is adjusted periodically to maintain a consistent rate of block creation. As more miners join the network, the difficulty increases to ensure that blocks are not mined too quickly. Conversely, if miners leave the network, the difficulty decreases to prevent excessively long block confirmation times.

- <span style="color:orange">Nonce</span>: Miners repeatedly change the nonce value in the block header and combine it with the other block information. The nonce is an arbitrary value that miners can adjust to change the resulting hash.
